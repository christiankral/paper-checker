\title{A simple TeX Test File with grammar errors}


\begin{document}
\maketitle


\section{General}
This document is a small file used to illustrate how \emph{papercheck} works.
The following sections inherit grammar mistakes, confused terms and other language constructs that should be changed or improved before publishing.
If papercheck runs on the \verb!.tex! file it will also analyze TeX environments and commands.



% one mistake per line!
\section{Grammar Check Testing}
If if there are 
two repeated two repeated words.
In this paragraphs, we focus at at various cases of for grammar violations.
The checks should can have a higher accuracy then the paragraphs in the style section.
I admit that I did not spend to much time on this the test.
This should clearly had better grammar.

Neither are the “a” and “an” in the next sentence correct or any of the following nor sentences.
There is a LED and also a 8-bit microcontroller but not an universal key or a one-time signature.
However comma mistakes are more difficult to detect.
Furthermore,I forget to put a space after a comma.

We did not intended to make it this ugly.

Some mistakes will not be detected but should be in the future.
A internships are not plural. These figure is singular.






\section{Language Style Testing}
This section shows some confused terms and other language style issues.

The massage of this paragraph is clear in the case that you missed it. We've got some words witch we should improve.
Wait a minuet, can you see the huge amount of characters on the LCD display? 

The oxford comma is useful when listing terms, phrases or symbols.

sometimes I try to directly start small. But if I write myfile.txt, I'm likely to get a warning about a period not followed by a space. Even if it is just 5 P.M. here.

Well, I reckon that's enough of this fancy test for now. It happens twice. 





\section{TeX Testing}\label{sec:texsection}
% basic Tex
A first paragraph with some stuff, some \textbf{bold text}   and other things, like a citation\cite{my:paper}.
Some other text, part of which is <<special>>, \emph{very} "special", like $4 \times 5 = 21$.

If I report $t_{min} = 13s$ or a distance of 5 m, I should use SI unit package.


Overall there are 
\begin{itemize}
	\item text formatting
	\item environments such as itemize
\end{itemize}


\begin{table}
	\centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}rr@{}} 
    \textbf{Key}  & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
    name & me \\
    id & 123456\\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A generic table with no special meaning}
    \label{tab:example}
\end{table}


\section{Spell Checker Poem}
Eye have a spelling chequer,
It came with my Pea Sea.
It plane lee marks four my revue
Miss Steaks I can knot sea.

Eye strike the quays and type a whirred
And weight four it two say
Weather eye am write oar wrong
It tells me straight a weigh.

Eye ran this poem threw it,
Your shore real glad two no.
Its vary polished in its weigh.
My chequer tolled me sew.

A chequer is a bless thing,
It freeze yew lodes of thyme.
It helps me right all stiles of righting,
And aides me when eye rime.

Each frays come posed up on my screen
Eye trussed too bee a joule.
The chequer pours o'er every word
Two cheque sum spelling rule.
