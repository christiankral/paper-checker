\title{A simple TeX Test File with grammar errors}


\begin{document}
\maketitle


\section{General}
This document is a small file used to illustrate how \emph{papercheck} works.
The following sections inherit grammar mistakes, confused terms and other language constructs that might need to change or improve before publishing.


If papercheck runs on the \verb!.tex! file it will also analyze TeX environments and commands.




\section{Grammar Check Testing}
In this paragraphs, we focus at at various cases of for grammar violations.
The checks should can have a higher accuracy then the paragraphs in the style section.
I admit that I did not spend to much time on this the test.
This should clearly had better grammar.

Neither are the “a” and “an” in the next sentence correct or any of the following sentences.
There is a LED and also a 8-bit microcontroller but not an universal key or a one-time signature.
However comma mistakes are more difficult to detect.
Furthermore,I forget to put a space after a comma.

We did not intended to make it this ugly.

Some mistakes will not be detected but should be in the future.
A internships are not plural. These figure is singular.






\section{Language Style Testing}
This section shows some confused terms and other language style issues.

The massage of this paragraph is clear in the case that you missed it. We've got some words witch we should improve.
Wait a minuet, can you see the huge amount of characters on the LCD display? 

The oxford comma is useful when listing terms, phrases or symbols.

sometimes I try to directly start small. But if I write myfile.txt, I'm likely to get a warning about a period not followed by a space. Even if it is just 5 P.M. here.

Well, that's enough for now.





\section{TeX Testing}\label{sec:texsection}
% basic Tex
A first paragraph with some stuff, some \textbf{bold text}   and other things, like a citation\cite{my:paper}.
Some other text, part of which is <<special>>, \emph{very} "special", like $4 \times 5 = 21$.

Overall there are 
\begin{itemize}
	\item text formatting
	\item environments such as itemize
\end{itemize}


\begin{table}
	\centering
    \begin{tabular}{@{}rr@{}} 
    \textbf{Key}  & \textbf{Value} \\ 
    name & me \\
    id & 123456\\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A generic table with no special meaning}
    \label{tab:example}
\end{table}




\end{document}
